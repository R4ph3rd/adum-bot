# Automatically apply to your ADUM courses
To stop loosing time on this beautiful website that is ADUM, here is a bot to apply for you to your desired classes for your PhD.

1. Use the dotenv file to create a .env file and fill your creds.
2. In main.js, fill the variable ``myCourses`` with your desired course names found on the catalog.
3. Run:
```sh
npm install
npm run apply
```

> NB: You can package it and make it an executable to launch every time you open your user session on your computer (so you can remove the timeout part)
